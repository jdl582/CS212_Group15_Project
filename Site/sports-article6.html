                Northern Arizona University made a bold impression this week as the Lumberjacks’ defense led the way to a convincing early-season victory. From the opening kickoff, NAU shut down their opponent’s drives with sharp tackling, tight coverage, and steady pressure at the line.
            <p  id = "ArticleBody">
                The defensive unit forced multiple turnovers, giving the Lumberjack offense plenty of opportunities to control the pace of the game. Big stops on third down and a key goal-line stand in the second half kept the momentum firmly in NAU’s favor.            </p>
            <p  id = "ArticleBody">
                Players credited their success to strong preparation and growing chemistry within the defensive squad. With such a commanding performance so early in the season, fans are hopeful the Lumberjacks’ defense will continue to set the tone in the weeks ahead.            </p>
